# DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

The DAO project is a decentralized autonomous organization implemented in Motoko. It allows users to create proposals, vote on them, and execute accepted proposals automatically.

## Overview

The DAO smart contract provides the following functionality:

- **Create Proposal**: Allows users to submit proposals for various actions.
- **Vote on Proposal**: Enables users to vote on proposals.
- **Execute Accepted Proposals**: Automatically executes proposals that have received enough votes.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have the Motoko compiler installed.
- Familiarize yourself with the Motoko programming language.
- Understand the concept of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

### Smart Contract Definition

The DAO smart contract defines the following types and functions:

- **Types**:
  - `SuperheroId`: Represents the unique identifier of a superhero.
  - `Superhero`: Represents a superhero, including their name and list of superpowers.

- **Functions**:
  - `create`: Creates a new superhero in the database.
  - `read`: Retrieves information about a superhero by their ID.
  - `update`: Updates the information of an existing superhero.
  - `delete`: Deletes a superhero from the database.

### Deploying and Interacting with the Smart Contract

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd dao
   ```

3. Compile the Motoko code:

   ```bash
   dfx build
   ```

4. Deploy the smart contract:

   ```bash
   dfx canister install --all
   ```

5. Interact with the smart contract using query and update calls:

   - **Create Proposal**:
     ```bash
     dfx canister call <canister_id> submit_proposal '(<payload>)'
     ```

   - **Vote on Proposal**:
     ```bash
     dfx canister call <canister_id> vote '(<args>)'
     ```

   - **Execute Accepted Proposals**:
     ```bash
     dfx canister call <canister_id> execute_accepted_proposals
     ```

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how you can use the DAO smart contract:

```motoko
import DAO "dao";

actor Main {
  public func main() : async {
    let daoActor = DAO.DAO();

    // Submit a proposal
    let proposalId = await daoActor.submit_proposal({
      canister_id = <canister_id>;
      method = "update";
      message = "Update proposal payload";
    });

    // Vote on a proposal
    let voteResult = await daoActor.vote({
      proposal_id = proposalId;
      vote = #yes; // or #no
    });
    switch (voteResult) {
      case (#ok(state)) {
        print("Vote successful. Proposal state: " # state);
      };
      case (#err(errorMessage)) {
        print("Vote failed: " # errorMessage);
      };
    }

    // Execute accepted proposals
    await daoActor.execute_accepted_proposals();
  }
}
```
