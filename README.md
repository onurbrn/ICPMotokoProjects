# Simple Motoko Projects

This repository contains a collection of simple projects implemented in the Motoko programming language. Each project has its own README file for detailed instructions. This README serves as a general guide on what Motoko is, how to set up your environment on Windows using WSL, how to install Rust, SUI, and Internet Computer, and how to start the projects.

## Motoko

Motoko is a programming language designed for the Internet Computer, a decentralized cloud computing platform. It is designed to enable the development of scalable and secure internet services directly on the internet, without the need for traditional hosting services.

## Installation

### Windows WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

1. Enable WSL on your Windows machine. You can find detailed instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
2. Install a Linux distribution from the Microsoft Store. Ubuntu is recommended.
3. Open the installed Linux distribution and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.

### Rust

1. Install Rust by following the instructions on the official Rust website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### SUI (Simple User Interface)

SUI is a library for building user interfaces in Motoko. It provides a simple and intuitive way to create web interfaces for your applications.

1. Install SUI by following the instructions on the SUI GitHub repository: [https://github.com/someone/sui](https://github.com/someone/sui).

### Internet Computer

1. Follow the official documentation to set up and install the Internet Computer environment: [https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/quickstart-intro.html](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/quickstart/quickstart-intro.html).
